# Agent Working Agreement

## Source of truth
- Architecture and detailed design: `docs/design/architecture-and-detailed-design.md`
- Execution plans: `docs/plan/`
- Execution graph machine source: `docs/plan/execution-graph.toml`
- Generated execution graph view: `docs/plan/execution-graph.md`
- Implementation and review reports: `docs/plan/reports/`
- Read requirements and current implementation evidence before changing design or code.

## Design rules
- Separate current implementation, accepted target design, assumptions, local decisions, and unresolved material decisions.
- Do not invent data fields, API behavior, tool names, command flags, or external semantics. Cite repository evidence or mark uncertainty.
- Verify external behavior against opened official or primary documentation and link the exact source in architecture and plans.
- Follow SOLID at real change boundaries. Do not create speculative interfaces, factories, plugin systems, or indirection without a demonstrated variation or testing boundary.
- Update architecture before creating a plan that depends on changed architecture.

## No historical baggage by default
This is a new project unless the user explicitly states otherwise. When a later accepted design conflicts with an earlier internal implementation, change the target implementation directly. Do not keep reserved fields, obsolete parameters, compatibility aliases, dead interfaces, transitional adapters, duplicate schemas, or shims solely to preserve an abandoned plan. If cleanup is too large, create an explicit follow-up plan to remove the obsolete design rather than silently retaining technical debt.

## Document boundaries
- `AGENTS.md` contains durable repository-wide agreements only.
- Package-specific schemas, contracts, implementation decisions, and plan details belong in the architecture document and relevant plan.
- Do not maintain an accumulating plan index here.

## Plan immutability
- A plan becomes immutable when handed to an implementation agent, execution begins, or a report records execution.
- Do not edit, rename, renumber, delete, or replace an immutable plan.
- Correct architecture first, then create a next-numbered compensating plan.

## Plan execution
- Read and understand the whole requested plan, governing architecture sections, predecessors, and registered official sources before editing.
- Fetch registered sources; do not implement from the planner's paraphrase alone.
- Ask the user when an uncovered decision changes product behavior, architecture, persistence, public contracts, security/privacy, compatibility, deployment responsibility, or acceptance criteria.
- Resolve bounded local implementation decisions using architecture, official documentation, and repository convention; record them in the implementation report.
- Preserve unrelated changes and stage only explicit in-scope files.

## Parallel execution
- Use MINE CLI/MCP to query and transition `docs/plan/execution-graph.toml`; treat the Markdown graph as generated read-only output. Use the plan's work-package DAG.
- Parallel lanes require disjoint write scopes, one owner per shared file, explicit start gates, join gates, and integration ownership.
- Manifests, lockfiles, migrations, generated schemas/clients, root quality configuration, central registries, the execution graph, and reports are serialized unless a plan explicitly assigns one owner.

## Repository quality gates
`mine-arch` must replace this table with the actual repository commands and configuration sources.

| Scope | Format | Lint/static analysis | Type check | Tests | Build/package |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `<scope>` | `<command>` | `<command>` | `<command or N/A>` | `<command>` | `<command>` |

- Run the narrowest relevant checks first, followed by required broader gates.
- Never call a timeout, missing tool, skipped command, warning, ignored diagnostic, or non-zero exit a pass.
- Do not weaken configuration, add blanket ignores, or change acceptance thresholds merely to obtain green output.

## Evidence and reports
- Record exact commands, exit codes, concise observed output, inspected artifacts, skipped checks, failures, remaining risks, and preserved unrelated changes in `docs/plan/reports/`.
- Implementation agents may conclude `IMPLEMENTED`, never `ACCEPTED`.
- Independent review is required for `ACCEPTED`.

## Commit discipline
- Use Conventional Commits and repository conventions.
- Stage explicit paths only; never use broad staging in a dirty worktree.
- Do not amend or rewrite another agent's shared history.
- Do not push, deploy, publish, upload, or perform other external mutations unless explicitly authorized.

## MINE graph discipline

- Never edit `docs/plan/execution-graph.toml` or `docs/plan/execution-graph.md` directly.
- Register plans and perform lifecycle transitions only through the installed `mine` MCP tools or `mine --format json` CLI.
- Carry the observed revision into every write operation and stop on revision conflicts.
