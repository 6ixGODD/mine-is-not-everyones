## Allowed transitions

| From | To | Gate |
|---|---|---|
| DRAFT | BLOCKED | Plan registered but one or more hard predecessors not yet accepted; `mine plan release` or automatic successor release inside `mine plan accept` |
| DRAFT | READY | Plan complete and every hard predecessor accepted; `mine plan release` or automatic successor release inside `mine plan accept` |
| BLOCKED | READY | All blocking conditions resolved (automatic successor release inside `mine plan accept`, or the blocker's own acceptance) |
| READY | IN_PROGRESS | Successful start, owner assigned, revision matches |
| IN_PROGRESS | IMPLEMENTED | Report and commit evidence registered |
| IMPLEMENTED | ACCEPTED | Independent review passes every hard contract |
| IMPLEMENTED | REJECTED | Independent review finds material failure |

`REJECTED` is **terminal**. A rejected plan is never revived, restarted, or
re-statused; repository evidence confirms this (the bootstrap-era rejected
Plan `02` stayed `REJECTED` after its compensating Plan `02-1` was accepted).
The earlier `REJECTED -> BLOCKED` row is removed as misleading historical
baggage: it implied a status transition that no operation performs.

Closing a rejection has two independent parts, both performed through the
accepted CLI; neither changes the rejected plan's status:

1. **Register the compensating plan** with `mine plan add` (hard predecessor
   set to the rejected plan's accepted predecessor, not the rejected plan).
2. **Rewire downstream successors** off the rejected plan onto the
   compensating plan with `mine plan rewire-compensation` (see
   [Compensation rewiring](#compensation-rewiring) below).

No generic `set-status` exists.

## Plan release

`mine plan release --id <plan-id>` is the explicit, deterministic operation
that moves a newly registered plan from `DRAFT` into the startable frontier.
Registration (`mine plan add`) always creates a `DRAFT` node by design: it
records the plan's identity, design references, write paths, and dependencies
but makes no claim about whether the plan may execute. Release is the
separate, explicit gate between registration and execution. Preserving that
distinction prevents a freshly added plan from becoming silently executable.

### Anchors and inputs

- The single input is the plan's id. No predecessor or status is supplied by
  the caller; the operation reads the current node and its hard predecessors
  under the graph lock.

### Preconditions (all checked under the graph lock, atomically)

1. The plan exists and its current status is exactly `DRAFT`. Any other
   status (`BLOCKED`/`READY`/`IN_PROGRESS`/`IMPLEMENTED`/`ACCEPTED`/`REJECTED`)
   fails with `MINE_INVALID_TRANSITION` and mutates nothing.
2. The graph's current revision must match the caller-supplied expectation
   (optimistic-concurrency), per the shared `save_with_revision` transaction.

### Mutation

- Compute `unsatisfied_predecessors` = the hard predecessors whose status is
  not `ACCEPTED`, in stable predecessor-list order.
- If `unsatisfied_predecessors` is empty (this includes a plan with no hard
  predecessors), transition the node `DRAFT -> READY`.
- Otherwise transition the node `DRAFT -> BLOCKED`.
- Refresh the node's `updated_at`; no other node is touched. Persistence and
  rendering are atomic via the shared `TomlStore::save_with_revision` path:
  lock -> reload -> revision check -> semantic checks -> status transition ->
  atomic TOML write -> deterministic Markdown render -> release lock. Every
  successful release increments the graph revision exactly once.

### Idempotency and re-run behavior

Release is **not** idempotent-success: it accepts only `DRAFT`. Re-running on
an already-released `READY` or `BLOCKED` node returns the precise stable error
`MINE_INVALID_TRANSITION` (`status_before` is not `DRAFT`) and writes nothing,
so callers cannot accidentally double-release. This is the documented
idempotency choice; automation that may race should read `mine plan show`
first or treat `MINE_INVALID_TRANSITION` as "already released".

### Result

The JSON envelope reports deterministically:

- `command`: `"plan.release"`;
- `revision_before` / `revision_after` (`revision_after == revision_before + 1`);
- `data.plan`, `data.status_before` (`"DRAFT"`), `data.status_after`
  (`"READY"` or `"BLOCKED"`), `data.hard_predecessors`, and
  `data.unsatisfied_predecessors` (empty for `READY`).

### Stability errors

- `MINE_PLAN_NOT_FOUND`: plan id absent.
- `MINE_INVALID_TRANSITION`: current status is not `DRAFT`.
- `MINE_REVISION_CONFLICT` / `MINE_LOCK_TIMEOUT`: shared transactional checks.

No arbitrary state-editing capability is introduced: release only moves a
`DRAFT` node to `READY`/`BLOCKED` based on hard-predecessor acceptance, behind
all validation above.

### Relationship to automatic successor release

`mine plan accept` keeps its existing automatic release pass: when a plan is
accepted, any `BLOCKED` successor whose hard predecessors are all now
accepted is moved to `READY` in the same transaction. That automatic pass and
`mine plan release` are two gates over the same allowed `DRAFT/BLOCKED ->
READY` edges; together they close the lifecycle gap where a standalone newly
registered `DRAFT` plan (no accepted upstream) could not previously become
executable. `mine plan release` never weakens `mine plan accept`'s release
pass and never alters non-`DRAFT` nodes.

## Validation

Validation includes unique IDs/paths, valid predecessors, acyclic hard dependencies, legal states, required files/evidence, valid design anchors, safe paths, generated-view revision parity, and branch/workspace consistency.

## Derived readiness

A node is ready only when every hard predecessor is accepted, design references are valid, no material decision remains, path ownership does not conflict, and stored state allows readiness.

## Compensation rewiring

`mine plan rewire-compensation --id <rejected-id>` is a deterministic,
first-class graph operation that replaces an explicitly rejected predecessor
with its registered compensating plan in every still-mutable downstream
successor. It is the only supported way to reroute downstream dependencies
after the bootstrap exception ended; manual editing of the graph files is
forbidden (`AGENTS.md`).

### Anchors and inputs

- The single input is the rejected plan's id. The replacement plan id is
  **derived** from the rejected plan's `compensating_plan` field — the single
  source of truth registered at reject time. The caller never supplies a
  replacement id, so dependency substitution can never be driven by a
  similar-looking id (no fuzzy/substring matching).

### Preconditions (all checked under the graph lock, atomically)

1. The original plan exists and its status is exactly `REJECTED`.
2. Its `compensating_plan` is non-empty and names an existing plan (the
   replacement). The replacement must not itself be `REJECTED`.
3. Every successor that lists the rejected id in either hard or soft
   predecessors must be in a still-mutable status: `DRAFT`, `BLOCKED`, or
   `READY`. Any successor in `IN_PROGRESS`, `IMPLEMENTED`, `ACCEPTED`, or
   `REJECTED` fails the operation with a stable error and rewires nothing.
4. The proposed rewired graph must remain acyclic (reuses `topological_sort`).
5. The graph's current revision must match the caller-supplied expectation
   (optimistic-concurrency), per the shared `save_with_revision` transaction.

### Mutation

- For each still-mutable successor, every exact occurrence of the rejected
  id in `hard_predecessors` and `soft_predecessors` is replaced by the
  compensating id in place. Predecessor order is preserved; no edges are
  added, removed, or reordered; unrelated predecessors and successors are
  untouched.
- The successor's `updated_at` is refreshed; the rejected plan's fields are
  not modified.
- Persistence and rendering are atomic via the shared
  `TomlStore::save_with_revision` path: lock -> reload -> revision check ->
  semantic checks above -> in-place replacement -> atomic TOML write ->
  deterministic Markdown render -> release lock. From the caller's
  perspective the graph mutation and its generated view change atomically.

### Idempotency

Re-running a completed rewiring is **safe idempotent success**: if no
successor still references the rejected id, the operation performs a
read-only load, writes nothing, bumps no revision, and returns
`revision_before == revision_after` with `affected_successors: []`. A
re-run that finds newly-added successors still referencing the rejected id
rewires them normally (a real mutation, revision bumps). A precise stable
error is reserved for genuine invalid state (not-rejected original,
missing/compensating-plan mismatch, locked successor, cycle), never for the
no-work case.

### Result

The JSON envelope reports deterministically:

- `command`: `"plan.rewire-compensation"`;
- `revision_before` / `revision_after` (equal on the idempotent no-op);
- `data.rejected_plan`, `data.compensating_plan`, and
  `data.affected_successors` (ids of successors whose predecessor lists
  changed, in stable plan-insertion order).

### Stability errors

- `MINE_PLAN_NOT_FOUND`: original or compensating plan missing.
- `MINE_INVALID_TRANSITION`: original is not `REJECTED`.
- `MINE_GRAPH_INVALID`: `compensating_plan` empty, replacement is `REJECTED`,
  or successors already rewired is not raised (see idempotency).
  `MINE_REWIRE_SUCCESSOR_LOCKED`: a referencing successor is in
  `IN_PROGRESS`/`IMPLEMENTED`/`ACCEPTED`/`REJECTED` (details name it).
- `MINE_GRAPH_CYCLE`: rewiring would create a hard-dependency cycle.
- `MINE_REVISION_CONFLICT` / `MINE_LOCK_TIMEOUT`: shared transactional checks.

No arbitrary graph-editing API is introduced: rewiring only substitutes a
rejected id with its declared compensating id in mutable successors' exact
predecessor entries, behind all validation above.

## Parallel wave

A wave is a stable maximal set of ready plans without ancestor relationships, exclusive-write overlap, exclusive/reserved overlap, or active conflicts.

## Workspace closure gate

Closure requires:

- every terminal implementation node accepted;
- no unresolved draft, blocked, ready, in-progress, implemented, or rejected node;
- final full `mine-sync` attestation not blocked;
- release verification passes;
- current branch is managed `dev`;
- working tree has no unclassified changes;
- expected workspace ID matches the ownership marker.
