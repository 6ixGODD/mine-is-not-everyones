# CLI Contract

## Human-facing core

Normal users should need only:

```text
mine init
mine status
mine doctor
```

All other commands are primarily invoked by Skills or advanced users.

## Command groups

```text
mine setup
mine update
mine uninstall
mine init
mine status
mine doctor
mine workspace open|status|close
mine graph validate|render|status|ready|wave|show
mine plan add|show|start|implemented|accept|reject|release|rewire-compensation
mine design backup|validate|status
mine repository version show|suggest|set
mine agent config|install|uninstall|status
mine dist sync|verify
mine scan plan-refs
mine mcp serve
```

Final names may change during implementation. Skills and documentation are regenerated from the actual stable contract before release.

## Machine-level vs repository-level commands

MINE has three distinct levels of operation; do not confuse them:

- **Machine-level Agent integration**: `mine setup` installs Skills and MCP
  configuration into coding-agent client directories (run once per machine;
  rerun to add or remove integrations). `mine update` / `mine uninstall`
  manage the installed binary and Agent integrations at machine level.
- **Machine-level installation status**: `mine agent status` lists the managed
  Agent installations and their health independent of any repository; it does
  not require an initialized MINE repository.
- **Repository-level initialization**: `mine init` creates `.mine/config.toml`,
  the design namespace, and governance at a repository root (run once per
  repository).
- **Repository-aware diagnostics**: `mine doctor` / `mine doctor --agents all`
  run inside an initialized repository and check `.mine/config.toml`, design
  marker/index, execution graph, Git branch, and (with `--agents`) per-Agent
  installation state. They are not machine-level commands.

A fresh machine-level install is verified with `mine agent status`; `mine doctor`
requires an initialized repository.

## `mine init`

`mine init`:

- discovers repository root and stable branch;
- initializes or validates `.mine/config.toml`;
- creates a repository UUID when unmanaged;
- creates `docs/design/` scaffold and `.mine-design.toml` when absent;
- backs up an unmarked or foreign-owned existing `docs/design/` to `docs/design-backup-<timestamp>/` and creates a fresh managed root;
- creates MINE sections in `AGENTS.md` without erasing unrelated content;
- configures supported agents when requested;
- initializes repository version from existing MINE state, reliable root version evidence, or `0.1.0`;
- performs no source scan, architecture generation, plan creation, agent invocation, business-code change, branch creation, commit, merge, or release.

## Workspace commands

`mine workspace open` creates the temporary `docs/plan/` workspace on the configured integration branch and generates an internal UUID. It takes no user-supplied release version.

`mine workspace close` validates closure and may purge only the ownership-marked `docs/plan/` tree with explicit expected workspace identity. Version determination is separate.

## Design backup

`mine design backup` is the deterministic backup mechanism used by `mine-sync`.

It:

- validates the design marker and repository ownership;
- creates `docs/design-backup-<UTC timestamp>/`;
- copies managed design without following external links;
- writes `*` to the backup root `.gitignore`;
- verifies copy completion;
- emits a structured manifest and backup path;
- performs no design mutation.

## Output modes

- default: concise human-readable output;
- `--format json`: stable machine-consumable envelope;
- `--quiet`: suppress non-error human output where meaningful;
- `--no-color`: deterministic plain text.

## JSON output

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "command": "plan.start",
  "repository": "D:/work/project",
  "workspace_id": "8dcd1df5-...",
  "revision_before": 7,
  "revision_after": 8,
  "data": {},
  "warnings": []
}
```

Errors use the same envelope with `ok: false`, stable `error.code`, human message, and structured details.

## Exit codes

- `0`: success;
- `2`: invalid invocation;
- `3`: repository, branch, namespace, or workspace gate failure;
- `4`: validation failure;
- `5`: revision or lock conflict;
- `6`: external dependency or Git evidence failure;
- `7`: partial success requiring repair;
- `1`: unexpected internal failure.

Exact values become public contract when released.

## Plan release

`mine plan release --id <plan-id>` moves a newly registered plan from `DRAFT`
into the startable frontier, deterministically. Registration (`mine plan add`)
always creates a `DRAFT` node; release is the explicit gate between
registration and execution. See
`docs/design/execution-graph/state-machine-and-algorithms.md#plan-release`
for the full algorithm.

- Accepts only a `DRAFT` plan; returns `MINE_INVALID_TRANSITION` for any other
  status and mutates nothing.
- Transitions `DRAFT -> READY` when every hard predecessor is `ACCEPTED`
  (including a plan with no hard predecessors); transitions `DRAFT -> BLOCKED`
  when one or more hard predecessors are not yet `ACCEPTED`.
- Never alters `IN_PROGRESS`/`IMPLEMENTED`/`ACCEPTED`/`REJECTED` plans.
- Goes through the shared transaction (`lock -> reload -> revision check ->
  semantic validation -> mutation -> atomic write -> deterministic render`);
  every successful release increments the graph revision exactly once.
- Not idempotent-success: re-running on an already-released node returns
  `MINE_INVALID_TRANSITION` and writes nothing.

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "command": "plan.release",
  "revision_before": 18,
  "revision_after": 19,
  "data": {
    "plan": "09",
    "status_before": "DRAFT",
    "status_after": "READY",
    "hard_predecessors": ["03"],
    "unsatisfied_predecessors": []
  },
  "warnings": []
}
```

Errors reuse stable `MINE_*` codes (`MINE_PLAN_NOT_FOUND`,
`MINE_INVALID_TRANSITION`, `MINE_REVISION_CONFLICT`, `MINE_LOCK_TIMEOUT`).

## Compensation rewiring

`mine plan rewire-compensation --id <rejected-plan-id>` reroutes downstream
dependencies from an explicitly rejected plan onto its registered compensating
plan. It is the deterministic, CLI-managed closure of `mine plan reject` (which
set `compensating_plan`), and the only supported rerouting path after the
bootstrap exception ended. See
`docs/design/execution-graph/state-machine-and-algorithms.md#compensation-rewiring`
for the full algorithm and preconditions.

- The single input flag is `--id` (the rejected plan id). The replacement is
derived from the rejected plan's `compensating_plan`; the caller never supplies
it, so substitution can never be triggered by a similar id.
- Rewiring goes through the shared application/persistence transaction
  (`lock -> reload -> revision check -> semantic validation -> mutation ->
  atomic write -> deterministic render`); the graph TOML and its generated
  Markdown change atomically from the caller's perspective.
- It verifies the original is `REJECTED`, `compensating_plan` names an existing
  non-rejected replacement, every affected successor is still mutable
  (`DRAFT`/`BLOCKED`/`READY`), no cycle is introduced, and unrelated predecessors
  and successors are unchanged.
- Repeating a completed rewiring is safe idempotent success: it writes
  nothing, bumps no revision, and returns `affected_successors: []`.
- It never weakens the immutability of accepted or active plans: successors in
  `IN_PROGRESS`/`IMPLEMENTED`/`ACCEPTED`/`REJECTED` are never touched.

### Result envelope

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "command": "plan.rewire-compensation",
  "revision_before": 17,
  "revision_after": 18,
  "data": {
    "rejected_plan": "05",
    "compensating_plan": "05-1",
    "affected_successors": ["06"]
  },
  "warnings": []
}
```

Errors reuse the stable `MINE_*` codes; rewiring-specific failures use
`MINE_REWIRE_SUCCESSOR_LOCKED` and the existing `MINE_GRAPH_CYCLE`. No
arbitrary graph-editing CLI is introduced.

## Design validation

`mine design validate` checks:

- marker exists and repository ID matches;
- `docs/design/index.md` exists;
- every index link resolves;
- child directories have indexes;
- no duplicate document IDs;
- plan anchors exist;
- size thresholds produce warnings;
- no duplicate document IDs;
- plan anchors exist;
- size thresholds produce warnings;
- stable branch contains no `docs/plan/`;
- no `docs/design-backup-*` path is tracked or staged for release.

## Stale-plan-reference scan

`mine scan plan-refs` is a read-only validation command, parallel to `mine graph validate` and `mine design validate`, that detects temporary historical Plan references (e.g. `Plan NN`) in tracked implementation content before stable release. It is the **authoritative cross-platform scanner**: a native Rust implementation with no Bash, WSL, or Git Bash dependency, so the release/review path works on Windows without WSL, Windows without `bash` on PATH, Linux, and macOS.

### Semantics (preserved from the accepted scanner contract)

- inspects **tracked** repository content (`git ls-files`), never an uncontrolled filesystem walk;
- detects temporary historical Plan references matching `(^|[^[:alnum:]_])[Pp]lan[[:space:]-]*[0-9]`;
- excludes temporary planning state and accepted documentation: `docs/plan/**`, `docs/design/**`, `docs/design-backup-*/**`, `docs/README.md`, root `README.md` / `README.zh-CN.md`, `tests/fixtures/**`, `**/testdata/**`;
- honors the explicit fixture exemption marker `mine-release-allow-plan-reference:` on the immediately preceding line;
- never rewrites source; it only reports evidence;
- reports exact `file:line` findings;
- `--check` mode exits non-zero when unexempted findings exist (release gate); without `--check` it prints findings and exits zero (repair mode);
- operates against the repository selected by normal CLI context, including `--repo`;
- supports `--format json` with stable machine-readable findings.

### Exit codes

- `0` no unexempted findings (or, without `--check`, findings reported for repair);
- `1` `--check` mode with unexempted findings;
- `2` usage error;
- non-zero without findings when the target is not a Git repository or Git inspection fails (fail-closed).
