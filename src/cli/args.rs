//! Clap-derived command-line model for `mine`.
//!
//! This module only models the CLI surface (commands, subcommands, flags,
//! and their help text). Parsing produces a [`Cli`] whose [`Cli::command`]
//! field is a [`Commands`] enum. Dispatch converts the parsed structure back
//! into the `ParsedArgs` + rest-token form expected by the existing handlers
//! in [`super::commands`], so handlers and the JSON envelope contract are
//! unchanged.
//!
//! Global options (`--repo`, `--format`, `--quiet`, `--no-color`) are declared
//! on the top-level [`Cli`] struct with `global = true` so they are accepted
//! before or after any subcommand.
