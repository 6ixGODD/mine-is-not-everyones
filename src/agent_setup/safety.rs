//! Path-safety guards for the agent installer.
//!
//! [`SafetyGuard`] is the single chokepoint every filesystem write goes
//! through. It rejects, before any mutation:
//!
//! - targets that resolve outside the injected configuration root (the hard
//!   test guard fails the operation rather than write outside the root);
//! - path traversal (`..` components);
//! - symlink/junction/reparse-point escapes (any symlink on the resolved
//!   path whose target leaves the root, or whose target cannot be
//!   canonicalized, is refused);
//! - destination-escape via absolute rel-to-root tricks.
//!
//! Canonicalization must work **even when the target does not yet exist**:
//! install creates new files/dirs, so the guard canonicalizes the parent
//! (which must exist) and appends the remaining components, then verifies the
//! resulting lexically-normalized path stays within the root. On platforms
//! where the parent itself does not yet exist, the guard walks up to the
//! nearest existing ancestor, canonicalizes it, and re-checks the remainder.
//!
//! No `unsafe` is used; cross-platform symlink/junction detection relies on
//! [`std::fs::symlink_metadata`] (reparse points surface as `is_symlink()` on
//! Windows junctions too).
