//! Typed error model with stable machine-readable codes.
//!
//! Plan 01 defines the error variants needed for repository discovery,
//! design-namespace validation, marker validation, configuration validation,
//! and identity reconciliation. Later plans extend this enum with the
//! execution-graph, plan-lifecycle, revision, lock, distribution, and
//! agent-configuration variants. Each variant exposes a stable [`MineError::code`]
//! string that becomes part of the public JSON error contract in Plan 03.
