//! Provides the system sources for repository identifiers and time.
//! Execution-graph persistence infrastructure: atomic
//! writes, exclusive file locking (via the vetted `fs4` crate), and the TOML
//! store. Read-only Git evidence and the safe design-backup
//! adapter. Later plans add the design index, repository locator, embedded
//! skills, and the event log.
