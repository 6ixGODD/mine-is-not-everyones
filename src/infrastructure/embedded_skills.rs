//! Embedded Skill payloads for release binaries.
//!
//! Embeds the five authoritative Skill directories directly into the
//! `mine` binary via `include_str!`, so standalone installation does not
//! require a Git checkout. The authoritative source is the repository-root
//! `skills/` directory (the only hand-edited Skill source, per
//! `docs/design/integrations/distribution.md`); the embedded content here is a
//! generated artifact kept in lock-step at **build time**.
//!
//! # Build-time verification
//!
//! `include_str!` fails the build if a referenced file does not exist, so the
//! list below is a build-time assertion that every embedded path resolves. The
//! companion test `tests/distribution/embedded.rs::embedded_skills_match_root`
//! walks `skills/` at test time and asserts that (a) every file in `skills/`
//! is embedded here and (b) every embedded entry matches its root file
//! byte-for-byte. Together these guarantee the embedded payload cannot drift
//! from the authoritative source without failing a gate.
//!
//! Adding a new Skill file requires adding an `include_str!` entry here; the
//! test catches omission. This is intentional: the list is a compile-time
//! inventory of embedded Skill content.
