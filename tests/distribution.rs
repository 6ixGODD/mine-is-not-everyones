//! Distribution and Skill-contract integration tests for Plan 06.
//!
//! These tests verify the final Skill contract (MCP-first / CLI-fallback
//! against the twelve accepted MCP tools), the distribution structure for
//! Claude Code / Codex / Pi / OpenCode, the deterministic synchronization
//! mechanism, embedded Skill payloads, and drift detection.
//!
//! Sync-algorithm tests run inside **isolated temporary directories** and never
//! modify real user configuration or the live repository. The real sync script
//! is exercised via subprocess only in read-only `--check` mode against the
//! repository itself.
